## What is this code repository for?

This repository is home to separate projects that interact with each other. Also known as a distributed system. 

More simply, this repository is a proving ground for demonstrating various ideas and topics that are discussed on blogs such as [event-sourcing.dev](https://www.event-sourcing.dev). Some branches and areas may be more experimental in nature for my own learning and solution-building.


## Documentation

Coming soon.


## Divisions - The Separate Systems

These are not truly separate, decoupled systems that live in separate repositories and managed by separate teams for obvious reasons.

- **Billing**
  - responsible for payments
- **Storefront**
  - responsible for consuming the orders feed from the store
- **Supply Chain**
  - responsible for incoming and outgoing of inventory


## Brief Change Log

Will flesh something more substantial in the future. For now these are some quick notes that summarize commits as the project's bare minimum is being built-up.
