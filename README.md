## What is this code repository for?

It is (currently) a .NET solution for separate projects that interact with each other. AKA a distributed system.

This is largely a test-bed for my own experiments, but will also be the subject of upcoming blogs on [event-sourcing.dev](https://www.event-sourcing.dev) and other fine platforms.

NOTE: This repository should never be considered "complete".
